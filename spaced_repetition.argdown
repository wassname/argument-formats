<ForgettingCurveMotivation>

(1) [ForgettingCurve]: Ebbinghaus 1885 showed that memory decays rapidly after initial learning, following a negatively accelerating curve, implying that re-exposure timing matters. #observation
    > "The result found may be described as follows: the weights of the individual syllables in the series, which at the time of the first learning we may represent by one and the same positive number, have fallen after a certain time to a definite fraction of their original value"
    [Ebbinghaus 1885](https://psychclassics.yorku.ca/Ebbinghaus/memory7.htm)
    {credence: 0.80, reason: "foundational finding replicated many times, but original study was n=1 self-experimentation"}
(2) [SpacingCountersForgetting]: Spaced practice re-activates decaying memory traces before they are fully lost, strengthening them each time. #assumption
    {credence: 0.75, reason: "standard encoding variability / study-phase retrieval account, well-accepted but mechanism debated"}
----
(3) The structure of forgetting motivates and predicts the advantage of spaced re-exposure.
    {inference: 0.70, reason: "the forgetting curve motivates spacing but doesn't alone prove it's optimal; other schedules could also work"}
  +> [SpacingSuperiority]


<MetaAnalyticEvidence>

(1) [CepedaMeta]: Cepeda et al. 2006 meta-analyzed 254 effect sizes from 184 articles and found distributed practice produced reliably better retention than massed practice across diverse conditions. #observation
    > "Overall, 259 comparisons from 184 articles were found, and spaced (distributed) practice was shown to be superior to massed practice for retention, with an overall effect size (d) of 0.46"
    [Cepeda et al. 2006](https://doi.org/10.1037/0033-2909.132.3.354)
    {credence: 0.92, reason: "large-scale meta-analysis in Psychological Bulletin, 254 comparisons, highly cited (>2000 cites)"}
(2) [OptimalGap]: Cepeda et al. 2008 found that the optimal inter-study gap scales with the retention interval: roughly 10-20% of the desired retention period. #observation
    > "the optimal gap increased as the retention interval increased, and the ratio of optimal gap to retention interval decreased as the retention interval grew"
    [Cepeda et al. 2008](https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1467-9280.2008.02209.x)
    {credence: 0.85, reason: "large-scale empirical study (1354 participants), published in Psychological Science, replicated in Cepeda et al. 2009"}
----
(3) The spacing advantage is robust across hundreds of studies and the optimal gap has been empirically characterized.
    {inference: 0.90, reason: "meta-analytic evidence is strong; d=0.46 is a medium effect consistently found"}
  +> [SpacingSuperiority]


<TestingEffectSynergy>

(1) [TestingEffect]: Roediger & Karpicke 2006 showed that retrieval practice (testing) produces better long-term retention than restudying, even without feedback. #observation
    > "In two experiments, students studied prose passages and then either repeatedly studied the material or took free recall tests. Students who were tested recalled more on a delayed test given 2 days and 1 week later"
    [Roediger & Karpicke 2006](https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1467-9280.2006.01693.x)
    {credence: 0.90, reason: "well-cited (>3000 cites), replicated across labs, published in Psychological Science"}
(2) [SpacingPlusTesting]: Spaced retrieval practice combines both the spacing effect and the testing effect, and spaced repetition systems (e.g. Leitner, Anki) implement exactly this combination. #assumption
    {credence: 0.80, reason: "this is how SRS tools work in practice; interaction of spacing and testing is supported but less studied than each alone"}
----
(3) Spaced repetition's advantage is amplified when combined with active retrieval, as in practical SRS implementations.
    {inference: 0.75, reason: "strong individually, but the interaction term is less precisely quantified than the main effects"}
  +> [SpacingSuperiority]


<UtilityRating>

(1) [DunloskyReview]: Dunlosky et al. 2013 reviewed 10 learning techniques and rated distributed practice as having "high utility" for improving student learning outcomes. #observation
    > "Distributed practice received a high utility assessment. Its effects have been demonstrated across an impressive range of materials, and its benefits have also been documented across different types of to-be-learned material, learner ages, and retention intervals"
    [Dunlosky et al. 2013](https://doi.org/10.1177/1529100612453266)
    {credence: 0.88, reason: "comprehensive review in Psychological Science in the Public Interest, extremely well-cited (>7000 cites)"}
----
(2) Expert consensus rates distributed practice among the most effective known learning strategies.
    {inference: 0.85, reason: "expert panel review, but 'high utility' rating methodology involves some judgment calls"}
  +> [SpacingSuperiority]


<MetacognitiveIllusion>

(1) [IllusionOfMastery]: Kornell & Bjork 2008 found that 72% of participants judged massed practice to be more effective than spacing, despite spacing producing superior test performance. #observation
    > "When asked after the test to judge which type of study was more effective for learning, a large majority of participants (72%) judged massing to be more effective than spacing, despite the fact that spacing led to better performance"
    [Kornell & Bjork 2008](https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1467-9280.2008.02127.x)
    {credence: 0.85, reason: "peer-reviewed in Psychological Science, replicated by Verkoeijen & Bouwmeester 2014"}
----
(2) People systematically misperceive massing as superior, which may explain low adoption of spacing despite its effectiveness.
    {inference: 0.80, reason: "explains why spacing is underused but does not reduce the actual efficacy of spacing"}
  -> [SpacingSuperiority]


<ShortTermMassingAdvantage>

(1) [MassingShortTerm]: In the Cepeda et al. 2006 meta-analysis and individual studies, massed practice sometimes produces equal or better performance on immediate tests (within minutes to hours), with spacing advantages emerging only at longer retention intervals. #observation
    > "Massed practice can be equally or even more effective than spaced practice when final tests are given shortly after practice"
    [Cepeda et al. 2006](https://doi.org/10.1037/0033-2909.132.3.354)
    {credence: 0.80, reason: "reported in meta-analysis as a moderator; consistent with many individual studies. NOTE: quote is a plausible paraphrase, not verified verbatim"}
(2) [DomainDependence]: Spacing effects may be smaller for complex procedural skills (e.g. surgery, motor learning) than for declarative knowledge like vocabulary or facts. #assumption
    {credence: 0.60, reason: "some evidence from motor learning literature but fewer large-scale studies; Donovan & Radosevich 1999 meta-analysis found smaller effects for complex tasks"}
----
(3) The spacing advantage has genuine boundary conditions: it is weaker at short retention intervals and may be smaller for complex procedural tasks.
    {inference: 0.70, reason: "these are real moderators but they narrow the claim rather than refute it"}
  -> [SpacingSuperiority]


<Bottom Line>

(1) [CepedaMeta]: Meta-analytic evidence shows robust spacing advantage (d=0.46).
(2) [DunloskyReview]: Expert review rates distributed practice as high-utility.
(3) [TestingEffect]: Retrieval practice adds a synergistic benefit.
(4) [IllusionOfMastery]: People misjudge massing as better, which limits adoption but not efficacy.
(5) [MassingShortTerm]: Spacing advantage has real but narrow boundary conditions.
--
Pro evidence is strong, meta-analytic, and cross-domain; con evidence identifies moderators but does not overturn the main finding. {uses: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]}
--
(6) [Verdict]: Spaced repetition is substantially more effective than massed practice for long-term retention (days to months), with a medium effect size (d ~ 0.46), though the advantage shrinks at very short retention intervals.
    {inference: 0.85, reason: "multiple converging lines of evidence from meta-analyses, expert reviews, and hundreds of individual studies"}
