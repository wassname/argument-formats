[SI Comparison]: Single LoRA achieves SI=24.28 vs 22.535. {credence: 0.90, tag: "observation", math: "24.28 > 22.535"}
    +> [Single LoRA Works]: Single LoRA is more stable and performant. {credence: 0.85}

[Metric Confound]: SI rewards coherence by construction. {credence: 0.70, tag: "observation"}
    - [Constraints Help]: Constraints improve real steering quality. {credence: 0.65}

[Linear Steering]: LLM behavior steerable by linear adapter scaling. {credence: 0.80, tag: "assumption"}
    >< [No Linear Steering]: Linear adapter scaling does not steer behavior. {credence: 0.20}
