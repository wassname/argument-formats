[Safety Via Restriction]: The primary path to AI safety is
  restricting access to dangerous capabilities, accepting
  reduced scrutiny as a tradeoff. #assumption

# Evidence For

<Marginal Risk Low>

(1) [Marginal Risk Finding]: Kapoor et al. 2024 assess the marginal risk
    of open foundation models relative to pre-existing technologies. #observation
    > "current research is insufficient to effectively characterize the marginal risk of open foundation models relative to pre-existing technologies"
    [Kapoor et al. 2024](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07918)
    {credence: 0.82, reason: "25 co-authors including Stanford HAI and Princeton, peer reviewed at ICML"}
(2) [Existing Harms Baseline]: Most misuse vectors (cyberattacks, scams,
    disinfo) are already achievable with pre-existing tools and closed
    model APIs. #assumption
    {credence: 0.80, reason: "conventional wisdom among security researchers; search engines and existing tools suffice for most attacks"}
----
(3) [Low Marginal Risk Conclusion]: Open weight models do not substantially
    increase marginal risk for most misuse categories compared to existing
    technology.
    {inference: 0.70, reason: "strong for current models, weaker for future frontier capabilities"}
  +> [Mandate Open Weights]

<Innovation And Research>

(1) [OLMo Reproducibility]: Groeneveld et al. 2024 release OLMo with
    full weights, training data, and code to accelerate language model
    science. #observation
    > "OLMo: Accelerating the Science of Language Models"
    [Groeneveld et al. 2024](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.00838)
    {credence: 0.88, reason: "concrete artifact from Allen AI, widely adopted by researchers"}
(2) [Research Requires Weights]: Mechanistic interpretability, adversarial
    robustness testing, and bias auditing all require access to model
    weights, not just API access. #assumption
    {credence: 0.90, reason: "consensus in ML safety research; API-only access blocks gradient-based analysis"}
----
(3) [Open Weights Enable Safety Research]: Mandating open weights would
    substantially accelerate independent AI safety research.
    {inference: 0.75, reason: "clear mechanism but mandate adds coercion beyond voluntary release"}
  +> [Safety Crux]

<Power Distribution>

(1) [Concentration Concern]: Kapoor et al. 2024 identify that open
    foundation models diversify the actors in AI development beyond a
    few large developers. #observation
    > "Open foundation models present significant benefits, with some caveats, that span innovation, competition, the distribution of decision-making power, and transparency"
    [Kapoor et al. 2024](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07918)
    {credence: 0.82, reason: "same highly-cited source, this claim is less contested"}
(2) [Concentration Is Dangerous]: Concentrating frontier AI capability
    in 3-5 companies creates single points of failure and
    regulatory capture risk. #assumption
    {credence: 0.70, reason: "plausible by analogy to tech monopolies, but companies also invest in safety"}
----
(3) [Distribution Improves Governance]: Mandating open weights would
    reduce dangerous concentration of AI capability.
    {inference: 0.60, reason: "weights alone are insufficient without compute and data access"}
  +> [Mandate Open Weights]

<NTIA Recommends Openness>

(1) [NTIA Finding]: The U.S. NTIA 2024 report concludes that current
    evidence does not warrant restricting open model weights. #observation
    > "current evidence is not sufficient to definitively determine either that restrictions on such open weight models are warranted, or that restrictions will never be appropriate in the future"
    [NTIA 2024](https://www.ntia.gov/issues/artificial-intelligence/open-model-weights-report)
    {credence: 0.78, reason: "official U.S. government report based on 332 public comments, but political context matters"}
(2) [Policy Baseline]: Absent clear evidence of harm, liberal democracies
    should default to permitting information sharing rather than
    restricting it. #assumption
    {credence: 0.75, reason: "strong liberal tradition, but exceptions exist for WMD-adjacent tech"}
----
(3) [Default To Openness]: The policy default should favor open weights
    until evidence of concrete marginal harm emerges.
    {inference: 0.65, reason: "reasonable but 'mandate' goes beyond 'permit' -- forcing release is stronger than allowing it"}
  +> [Mandate Open Weights]

// ============================================================
// CON ARGUMENTS
// ============================================================

# Evidence Against

<Safety Training Removal>

(1) [Fine Tune Attack]: Qi et al. 2023 show that safety alignment of
    LLMs can be removed by fine-tuning on as few as 10 adversarial
    examples. #observation
    > "the safety alignment of LLMs can be compromised by fine-tuning with only a few adversarially designed training examples"
    [Qi et al. 2023](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.03693)
    {credence: 0.88, reason: "well-cited, replicated across models, published at ICLR"}
(2) [Weights Enable Fine Tuning]: Open weight release gives anyone the
    ability to fine-tune, unlike API-only access where the provider
    controls fine-tuning. #assumption
    {credence: 0.95, reason: "definitionally true -- weights are sufficient for fine-tuning"}
----
(3) [Safety Removal Is Trivial]: Mandating open weights would make
    safety guardrail removal trivially easy for any actor with
    basic ML skills.
    {inference: 0.85, reason: "direct logical consequence; 10 examples and $0.20 of compute"}
  -> [Safety Crux]

<Irreversibility Problem>

(1) [Irreversibility Claim]: Bommasani et al. 2024 note that governing
    open foundation models is complicated by the inability to revoke
    access after release. #observation
    > "Considerations for governing open foundation models"
    [Bommasani et al. 2024, Science](https://doi.org/10.1126/science.adp1848)
    {credence: 0.85, reason: "published in Science, authoritative venue"}
(2) [Future Risk Uncertainty]: Frontier model capabilities are advancing
    rapidly, and weights released today may enable harms not foreseeable
    at release time. #assumption
    {credence: 0.65, reason: "plausible concern but speculative about specific future harms"}
--
Irreversibility of release combined with uncertain future capabilities
{uses: [1, 2]}
--
(3) [No Recall Possible]: A mandate forces irreversible release,
    eliminating the option to restrict access if dangerous capabilities
    are later discovered.
    {inference: 0.80, reason: "strong logical step -- you cannot un-release weights"}
  -> [Mandate Open Weights]

<Enforcement Difficulty>

(1) [Frontier AI Definition Problem]: Anderljung et al. 2023 discuss
    the difficulty of defining which AI systems count as frontier and
    should be regulated. #observation
    > "Frontier AI Regulation: Managing Emerging Risks to Public Safety"
    [Anderljung et al. 2023](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.03718)
    {credence: 0.80, reason: "multi-institutional author team, widely cited in policy discussions"}
(2) [Jurisdiction Problem]: AI developers can relocate to jurisdictions
    without mandates, and model weights can be leaked or
    reverse-engineered. #assumption
    {credence: 0.75, reason: "demonstrated by global software industry patterns"}
----
(3) [Mandate Unenforceable]: A government mandate to open-source frontier
    weights would be difficult to define, scope, and enforce across
    jurisdictions.
    {inference: 0.70, reason: "strong for unilateral mandates, weaker if international coordination achieved"}
  -> [Enforcement Crux]

// ============================================================
// Undercut (Pattern 3): Even if safety removal is easy,
// the marginal risk argument limits its significance
// ============================================================

<Marginal Risk Undercut>

(1) [Low Marginal Risk Conclusion]
(2) [API Jailbreaks Exist]: Closed models are also jailbroken routinely
    via prompt injection without needing weights. #assumption
    {credence: 0.85, reason: "demonstrated repeatedly against GPT-4, Claude, etc."}
----
(3) [Safety Removal Not Marginal]: The ease of safety removal from open
    models matters less when closed models are also routinely bypassed.
    {inference: 0.55, reason: "partially valid but weight access enables more thorough removal than prompt hacks"}
  _> <Safety Training Removal>

// ============================================================
// Synthesis: Bottom Line (Pattern 7)
// ============================================================

<Bottom Line>

(1) [Low Marginal Risk Conclusion]
(2) [Open Weights Enable Safety Research]
(3) [Safety Removal Is Trivial]
(4) [No Recall Possible]
(5) [Default To Openness]
(6) [Mandate Unenforceable]
--
Weighing pro and con arguments {uses: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]}
--
(7) [Verdict]: The case for mandating open weights is weak. Open release
    has real benefits for research and competition, and current marginal
    risks are low. But a mandate specifically is too strong: it forces
    irreversible release, is hard to enforce, and the right policy is
    permitting and encouraging openness rather than compelling it.
    {inference: 0.40, reason: "pro-openness evidence is strong but supports permitting, not mandating; irreversibility and enforcement concerns reduce mandate case"}
  -> [Mandate Open Weights]
