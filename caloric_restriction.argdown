# Evidence For

## Primate Evidence

<Primate CR Survival> #pro

(1) [Wisconsin Survival]: Mattison et al. 2017 reconciled the Wisconsin
    and NIA rhesus monkey CR studies in a joint reanalysis. #observation
    > "these data confirm that health benefits of CR are conserved in monkeys and suggest that CR mechanisms are likely translatable to human health"
    [Mattison et al. 2017, Nature Communications](https://doi.org/10.1038/ncomms14063)
    {credence: 0.82, reason: "joint reanalysis by both study teams, published in Nature Comms, 783 citations"}
(2) [Wisconsin Mortality]: Colman et al. 2014 showed CR significantly
    reduced age-related and all-cause mortality in rhesus monkeys
    on ~30% restriction since young adulthood. #observation
    > "CR significantly improves age-related and all-cause survival in monkeys on a long-term ~30% restricted diet since young adulthood"
    [Colman et al. 2014, Nature Communications](https://doi.org/10.1038/ncomms4557)
    {credence: 0.80, reason: "671 citations, long-term study, but single cohort"}
(3) [Primate Translatable]: If CR extends lifespan in our closest
    evolutionary relatives, the mechanism is likely conserved in
    humans. #assumption
    {credence: 0.55, reason: "plausible but humans differ in metabolism, diet, environment; 30-year monkey lifespan vs 80-year human lifespan makes direct extrapolation uncertain"}
--
Primate survival benefits suggest CR mechanisms translate to humans {uses: [1, 2, 3]}
--
(4) [Primate Evidence Supports]: CR extends survival in primates,
    suggesting conserved longevity mechanisms relevant to humans.
    {inference: 0.65, reason: "strong primate evidence but translating magnitude to humans requires assumptions"}
  +> [CR Extends Human Lifespan]

## Human Biomarker Evidence

<CALERIE Slows Aging> #pro

(1) [DunedinPACE Result]: Waziry et al. 2023 found that 2 years of CR
    slowed the pace of biological aging as measured by DunedinPACE in
    the CALERIE RCT (n=220 healthy adults). #observation
    > "CALERIE intervention slowed the pace of aging, as measured by the DunedinPACE DNAm algorithm"
    [Waziry et al. 2023, Nature Aging](https://doi.org/10.1038/s43587-022-00357-y)
    {credence: 0.88, reason: "RCT, 205 citations, published in Nature Aging, rigorous methodology"}
(2) [Small Effect]: The same study found the treatment effect was a
    2-3% reduction in pace of aging (Cohen's d ~0.25). #observation
    > "Treatment effect sizes were small. Nevertheless, modest slowing of the pace of aging can have profound effects on population health"
    [Waziry et al. 2023, Nature Aging](https://doi.org/10.1038/s43587-022-00357-y)
    {credence: 0.88, reason: "same RCT, directly reported effect size"}
(3) [Biomarker To Lifespan]: Slowing the pace of biological aging as
    measured by DNAm proxies translates to actual lifespan extension. #assumption
    {credence: 0.45, reason: "DunedinPACE predicts mortality in observational data, but no interventional proof that changing it changes lifespan"}
--
An RCT shows CR slows a validated aging biomarker, but translation to lifespan is unproven {uses: [1, 2, 3]}
--
(4) [Biomarker Supports CR]: CR slows biological aging in humans per
    RCT evidence, but the magnitude is small and the lifespan link
    is indirect.
    {inference: 0.50, reason: "surrogate endpoint, not hard mortality data; effect size is modest"}
  +> [CR Extends Human Lifespan]

## Epidemiological Evidence

<Okinawan Epidemiology> #pro

(1) [Okinawan CR]: Willcox & Willcox 2013 reviewed Okinawan centenarian
    data showing historically low caloric intake relative to Japan. #observation
    > "the traditional Okinawan diet is remarkably consistent with the standard CR diet used in animal studies"
    [Willcox & Willcox 2013, Current Opinion in Clinical Nutrition](https://doi.org/10.1097/MCO.0000000000000019)
    {credence: 0.65, reason: "review of ecological data, but retrospective and uncontrolled"}
(2) [Ecological Confounders]: The Okinawan longevity advantage could be
    explained by genetics, social cohesion, physical activity, diet
    composition (not just calories), or data quality. #assumption
    {credence: 0.60, reason: "multiple plausible confounders in any ecological comparison"}
--
Okinawan data is consistent with CR benefits but confounded {uses: [1, 2]}
--
(3) [Okinawan Suggestive]: Okinawan longevity provides weak suggestive
    evidence for CR in humans, heavily confounded.
    {inference: 0.35, reason: "ecological data with many alternative explanations"}
  +> [CR Extends Human Lifespan]

# Evidence Against

## No Direct Evidence

<No Direct Human Evidence> #con

(1) [No Mortality RCT]: No randomized controlled trial has measured
    the effect of CR on human mortality or lifespan as a primary
    endpoint. #assumption
    {credence: 0.95, reason: "factual: no such trial exists or is feasible given human lifespan"}
(2) [Surrogate Gap]: The CALERIE trial used biomarkers, not mortality,
    and its authors note this limitation explicitly. #observation
    > "a conclusive test of the geroscience hypothesis will require trials with long-term follow-up to establish effects of intervention on primary healthy-aging endpoints, including incidence of chronic disease and mortality"
    [Waziry et al. 2023, Nature Aging](https://doi.org/10.1038/s43587-022-00357-y)
    {credence: 0.90, reason: "authors themselves acknowledge this gap"}
--
Without mortality data, the core claim remains unproven in humans {uses: [1, 2]}
--
(3) [No Hard Evidence]: The claim that CR extends human lifespan
    lacks direct experimental support.
    {inference: 0.85, reason: "absence of evidence is strong when the right experiment has never been done"}
  -> [CR Extends Human Lifespan]

## Contradictory Primate Results

<Primate Studies Contradictory> #con

(1) [NIA No Survival]: Mattison et al. 2012 reported the NIA primate
    study found no significant survival benefit of CR. #observation
    > "Impact of caloric restriction on health and survival in rhesus monkeys from the NIA study"
    [Mattison et al. 2012, Nature](https://doi.org/10.1038/nature11432)
    {credence: 0.80, reason: "published in Nature, well-designed, but later reconciliation paper explains some discrepancies"}
(2) [Diet Differences]: The 2017 reconciliation attributed differences
    partly to diet composition and onset age, meaning CR effects are
    sensitive to implementation details. #observation
    > "We describe differences in study design that could contribute to differences in outcomes, and we report species specificity in the impact of CR in terms of optimal onset and diet"
    [Mattison et al. 2017, Nature Communications](https://doi.org/10.1038/ncomms14063)
    {credence: 0.82, reason: "same reconciliation paper; acknowledged by both research groups"}
--
Primate evidence is weaker than it appears because results depend on protocol details {uses: [1, 2]}
--
(3) [Primate Fragile]: The primate survival benefit is sensitive to
    diet composition and onset timing, weakening its generalizability.
    {inference: 0.55, reason: "reconciliation explains some discrepancy but also shows effect is fragile"}
  -> [CR Extends Human Lifespan]

## Adverse Effects

<Muscle And Bone Loss> #con

(1) [Lean Mass Loss]: Caloric restriction in humans causes loss of lean
    body mass, typically ~25-30% of total weight lost is muscle. #observation
    > "Caloric restriction alone improves physical function and quality of life in older adults with obesity but is associated with loss of lean mass and increases fracture risk"
    [Jiang & Villareal 2019, Current Opinion in Clinical Nutrition](https://doi.org/10.1097/MCO.0000000000000520)
    {credence: 0.80, reason: "review of clinical evidence, consistent across multiple studies"}
(2) [Sarcopenia Risk]: In older adults, muscle loss from CR could
    accelerate sarcopenia, increasing fall risk and mortality. #assumption
    {credence: 0.60, reason: "clinically plausible, especially relevant for the older population most interested in longevity interventions"}
--
CR side effects could offset lifespan gains, especially in older adults {uses: [1, 2]}
--
(3) [Adverse Effects Offset]: Muscle and bone loss from CR may
    partially offset any longevity benefit, particularly in elderly
    populations.
    {inference: 0.45, reason: "real concern but potentially mitigable with exercise and protein; CALERIE participants were not old"}
  -> [CR Extends Human Lifespan]

## Adherence Undercut

<Adherence Undercut> #con

(1) [Poor Adherence]: In CALERIE, participants prescribed 25% CR
    actually achieved only ~12% on average. #observation
    > "the %CR achieved by participants in the treatment group varied, with most participants achieving doses below the prescribed 25% (mean = 11.9, s.e.m. = 0.7%)"
    [Waziry et al. 2023, Nature Aging](https://doi.org/10.1038/s43587-022-00357-y)
    {credence: 0.90, reason: "directly reported from the RCT"}
----
(2) [Adherence Limits Translation]: Even if CR works in principle,
    sustained adherence at effective doses may be impractical for
    most humans.
    {inference: 0.70, reason: "practical concern that limits real-world benefit even if mechanism is real"}
  _> <CALERIE Slows Aging>

# Synthesis

<Bottom Line>

(1) [Primate Evidence Supports]
(2) [Biomarker Supports CR]
(3) [Okinawan Suggestive]
(4) [No Hard Evidence]
(5) [Primate Fragile]
(6) [Adverse Effects Offset]
--
Weighing pro and con arguments {uses: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]}
--
(7) [Verdict]: CR probably slows human aging processes modestly,
    but whether this translates to meaningful lifespan extension
    remains unproven. The strongest evidence is for health-span
    improvements rather than lifespan extension per se. Best
    estimate: more likely than not that CR has some positive effect
    on human longevity, but the magnitude is uncertain and likely
    smaller than animal models suggest.
    {inference: 0.45, reason: "strong mechanistic plausibility and primate data, but no direct human mortality evidence and small effect sizes on biomarkers"}
